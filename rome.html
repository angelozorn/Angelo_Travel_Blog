        <h2>Rome</h2>
        <p>
            There has been a joke going around social media for quite some time now about how often men think about the Roman Empire. I never understood the joke until I visited Rome and greater Italy. Now, I absolutely understand the joke and think about the Roman Empire at least twice a week. From the Coliseum to the Roman Forum to Pompeii, their ancient civilization was way ahead of its time. 
        </p>
        
        <section class="post-content">
            <h3>Coliseum</h3>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper double-image">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="Rome_Coliseum1.jpg" alt="Coliseum 1" class="blog-post-img">
                    <img src="Rome_Coliseum2.jpg" alt="Coliseum 2" class="blog-post-img">
                </div>
                <p class="caption">I like it when I get lost in something and all my thoughts are clear. That’s what happened at the Coliseum. I played heavy bass music, walked around, and took it all in. The combination of sheer size, history, and beauty was so impressive. They had a museum inside the coliseum, which I fully immersed myself in. Something I found hilarious was that there's evidence that people would gamble on the gladiators. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper"> 
                <img src="Rome_RomanForum.jpg" alt="Roman Forum" class="blog-post-img"> 
                <p class="caption">Right next to the Coliseum was the Roman Forum. A collection of ancient Roman temples and ruins of a thriving city. I had the same feeling in there as I did in the Coliseum. </p> 
            </div>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper double-image">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="Rome_Pantheon.jpg" alt="Rome Pantheon" class="blog-post-img">
                    <img src="Rome_Fountain.jpg" alt="Trevi Fountain" class="blog-post-img">
                </div>
                <p class="caption">The Pantheon and Trevi Fountain were less impressive than the remains of the Roman Empire however, I had to check them out. Honestly, I liked other churches better than the Pantheon. I like a song called Pantheon by Seven Lions and his label Ophelia, so I listened to it a few times inside the monument. The Trevi Fountain was beautiful, but it was so packed when I went that it was difficult to fully appreciate it.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="image-caption-wrapper"> 
                <img src="Rome_JesusLasers.jpg" alt="Jesus Lasers Painting" class="blog-post-img"> 
                <p class="caption">One of my favorite paintings I saw at the Vatican. I love lasers so I appreciated the use of them here before modern technology was invented.</p> 
            </div>
			
            <div class="image-caption-wrapper"> 
                <img src="Rome_SidewalkMemorial.jpg" alt="Sidewalk Holocaust Memorial" class="blog-post-img"> 
                <p class="caption">A Holocaust sidewalk memorial in Rome. They were truly everywhere in Europe. I was so surprised that these memorials are not discussed more in school or in America in general. It was very moving to see them throughout Europe, even in places I wouldn’t expect.</p> 
            </div>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper double-image">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="Rome_Basillica1.jpg" alt="Rome Basilica 1" class="blog-post-img">
                    <img src="Rome_Basillica2.jpg" alt="Rome Basilica 2" class="blog-post-img">
                </div>
                <p class="caption">Four kilometers from the Vatican City lies the Basilica San Giovanni Laterno. It is the only "archbasillica” in the world because it serves as the seat of the Pope. It was massive, having many stunning alters off to the sides. When I was there, a mass was happening at the main altar for a select group of people. It was roped off, and visitors had to stay far away. I could feel how sacred the place was.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper double-image">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="Rome_VaticanSquare.jpg" alt="Vatican Square" class="blog-post-img">
                    <img src="Rome_VaticanSicilyMap.jpg" alt="VaticanSicilyMap" class="blog-post-img">
                </div>
                <p class="caption">On a rainy day, I went to The Vatican. The square was not that impressive, but the museum was spectacular. There was a long hallway with maps of all the regions of Italy on the walls. I spent almost an hour carefully glossing over each map, looking for all the places I visited. I spent the most time on the Sicily map pictured above. There was a one-way route all visitors must take through the museum that ended with the Sistine Chapel. My dad has used The Creation of Adam as a logo for his business for as long as I can remember, so I was eager to see the real thing. Everywhere	I looked, there was absurd beauty. Every time I looked at a new section of the chapel, I found something amazing. There is a line from Robin Williams in the movie Good Will Hunting about never knowing what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. I couldn’t stop thinking about that line while I was there. Now I know.</p>

            <h3>Overall</h3>
            <p>People say that Rome is overrated. I completely disagree. I loved it. I think it had a lot to do with the hostel I stayed at - Ostello Bello. It was probably the best hostel I stayed at on my whole trip. I met some incredible people, and it was centrally located right next to the Coliseum.</p>
