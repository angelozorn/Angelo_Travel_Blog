            <h2>Belgium Trip</h2>
            <p>
                I spent about a week in Belgium, but most of my time was spent at Tomorrowland festival, which is covered in a different post. I took a quick stop in Brussels and then spent 5 nights in Antwerp. Belgium was my introduction to mainland Europe as I came from the UK by train. The train ride through the French countryside was absolutely beautiful. In Brussels, I hung out with some people I met online through the Yes Theory community and reconnected with an old friend I met over 10 years ago in Los Angeles. It was great to see him. Then I spent some time in Antwerp, which had a breathtaking train station as well as the best beer I ever had in my life, called the Bourgogne des Flandres or the Flanders Red.

                        On my first night in Brussels, I met up with three friends from the Yes Theory community. Yes Theory is one of my favorite YouTube channels, which tries to get people out of their comfort zone and say Yes! to life. We had dinner and drinks at a beautiful food court with options from all over the world. Then we walked around the city and I had my private tour guides. The left photo is me in the city center. We also went to the Manneken Pis fountain, a famous statue of a little boy peeing. The next day, I saw my friend Antoine, and we went to an amazing rooftop bar with 360° views of the city. I love rooftops and landscapes!

                        I’ve been communicating with Antoine over Snapchat for over 10 years since I met him in Los Angeles at a hotel. I was at a travel baseball tournament, and he was visiting America. He always said to come to Belgium, and we would hang out. So I made it happen! After the rooftop, we went all over the city, partying and meeting new people. We met some other French people, and hung out with them for the rest of the night. One guy in fashion named Ken was friends with the famous designer Virgil Abloh, who tragically passed away. I also met three people from the Bay Area in line for food who were going to Tomorrowland. I ended up hanging out with them at the festival and later in Amsterdam. I hope to hang out with them again here at home.

                        This train station was gorgeous both inside and out. It had over 25 platforms, so it was like a maze. I arrived and departed Antwerp through this station, and I used it to get to and from Tomorrowland every day. This station will always have a special place in my heart.

                <h3>Overall</h3>
                <p>
                    Belgium is a diverse place. For example, in Brussels, they speak French, and in Antwerp, they speak Dutch. On all the trains, they announce everything in both languages. I liked that aspect of the country. The people were super kind, and everything was easygoing and casual. I would absolutely go back to Belgium, even if it's just for the beer, specifically the Flanders Red.
