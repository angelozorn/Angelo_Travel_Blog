        <h2>Florence</h2>
        <p>
           Finished out the trip in Florence. It was bittersweet for me in this city because it marked the end of my trip. 
        </p>
        
        <section class="post-content">
            <h3>Piaza Michael Angelo</h3>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper"> 
                <img src="Florence_PiazaSteps.jpg" alt="Piaza Michael Angelo" class="blog-post-img"> 
                <p class="caption">The Piazza Michael Angelo steps. I went there back-to-back nights on the last two nights of my trip. The first time, I met up with some people from my hostel, and we went to dinner after sunset. The second night, I went with one person from my hostel, and it rained on the walk back.</p> 
            </div>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper"> 
                <img src="Florence_River.jpg" alt="Florence River" class="blog-post-img"> 
                <p class="caption">The river separated the city center from the surrounding suburbs where locals live. The Piazza Michael Angelo was on the suburban side, so I had to cross the bridge to get there. The river provided amazing views from the windows of tall buildings and gave the city a more natural feel. </p> 
            </div>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper triple-image">

                    <img src="Florence_MichaelangeloTomb.jpg" alt="Michael Angelo Tomb" class="blog-post-img">
                    <img src="Florence_GalileoTomb.jpg" alt="Galileo Tomb" class="blog-post-img">
                </div>
                <p class="caption">I never got tired of going to churches. The St. Croce Cathedral is home to the tombs of two great Italian historical figures: Galileo and Michael Angelo. Obviously, all the words on the tombs were in Italian, so I couldn’t understand them. However, I felt connected to their story, knowing what was left of their remains was right in front of me.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="caption">Unfortunately, I didn’t see the real David statue at The Academy Museum because the tickets were sold out. I had to settle for the Uffizi Museum, which was just as good. The Uffizi Museum is known for its Caravaggio and Michael Angelo pieces. I got to see them all. The museum’s layout is similar to the Vatican Museum because it’s a one-way set path from start to finish. I ran into a guy from New York who sketched with pencil and paper. He wanted me to take pictures of him in his natural habitat. Then, we chatted for 15 minutes, and he showed me all the other works in his sketchbook. He traveled to world, going to museums, and sketching ancient art.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="caption">The stoicism philosophy inspires me greatly. I believe I cannot control what happens, but I can control how I let things affect me and how I respond. Marcus Aurelius, the ancient Roman emperor, was considered one of the founders of the philosophy along with Seneca. I read his book/journal Meditations, and I want to read it again. There were many busts and sculptures of Aurelius across all the museums in Italy. He is greatly appreciated there. </p>

                <p class="caption">Messina is now my favorite beer. I know it is impossible to get here in America. I hope to have it again as soon as possible. </p>

            <h3>Overall</h3>
            <p>Florence was a perfect place to end my trip. I remember everything about the city. My hostel was lovely and all the people I met there were amazing. One thing I will never forget about Florence is the sandwiches. They all come on focaccia bread, and right before they give it to you, they brush olive oil on top of the bread with a brush and then sprinkle salt on top of that.</p>
