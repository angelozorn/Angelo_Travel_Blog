        <h2>Naples, Sorrento, Amalfi</h2>
        <p>
            A week of highlights in central Italy with my dad. After Sicily, we took a 1-hour flight from Palermo, Sicily, to Naples on Italy's mainland. Upon arrival, we drove to two towns where some of my dad’s relatives were from. Then we went to the Amalfi coast, Sorrento, and back to Naples.
        </p>
        
        <section class="post-content">
            <h3>Campobasso</h3>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper double-image">
                <div class="image-container">

                    <img src="Campobasso_Street.jpg" alt="Street" class="blog-post-img">
                </div>
                <p class="caption">This is the street where my dad’s great grandma Carmella lived, and my dad is pictured in front of her house. She left this town and took a one-way trip to America over 100 years ago. The town, named Campobasso, actually had a lot more life than I expected. It is the capital of a small region in South Central Italy called Molise. Unfortunately, we didn’t walk around the town very much and only went to Carmella’s house. The language barrier was a major factor as the people we tried to talk to didn’t speak any English.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper double-image">

                </div>
                <p class="caption">My dad found Carmella’s birth certificate online and had one of his Italian friends translate it. He tracked down the exact address and we hunted it down in real life halfway across the world from our own home. </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Morcone</h3>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper double-image">
                <div class="image-container">

                    <img src="Morcone_View.jpg" alt="View" class="blog-post-img">
                </div>
                <p class="caption">Carmella’s husband, Sabatino was from another town called Morcone, only about a 20-minute drive from Campobasso. It was smaller and more secluded on top of a hill. The view of the Italian countryside was incredible as you could see rolling hills for miles. We could even see Campobasso! At the very top was an old castle that provided a lookout for people protecting the city from intruders hundreds of years ago.</p>
            </div>

                <p class="caption">My dad and I were drawn to a grass park next to a river where we imagined our ancestors running around in their days. The park was about the size of a soccer field and surrounded by trees and fences. The park was deserted except for us taking pictures and using our imaginations.</p>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper"> 
                <img src="Morcone_Cat.jpg" alt="Morcone Cats" class="blog-post-img"> 
                <p class="caption">There was an exceptional amount of wild cats roaming the streets of Morcone. Wild cats were quite common throughout Europe. However, Morcone had families everywhere. It gave the city charm and natural character.</p> 
            </div>

            <h3>Amalfi</h3>
            <div class="image-caption-wrapper double-image">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="Amalfi_Minori1.jpg" alt="Minori Accommodation View" class="blog-post-img">

                </div>
                <p class="caption">The Amalfi Coast had the craziest driving conditions I ever experienced. I expected it to be bad, but it was 100x worse than I thought. Amalfi driving was a narrow, barely two-lane road, with wide busses, mopeds lane splitting, and impatient Italian drivers honking. Every time we got on the road was the most stressful ride of our life. When we finally arrived at the town we were staying in, Minori, we had to drive up a one-lane road to find our accommodation on a lemon farm on top of a mountain. Then, after parking, we had to climb 150 stairs to reach the house. It was worth it though for the superb view. I liked it being off the beaten path in nature. The next morning, we went to a legendary pastry shop upon the recommendation of our tour guide in Sicily, Mimo. They had over six pages of pastries and cakes on the menu. It lived up to the hype - truly incredible.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="caption">The most famous hike on the Amalfi Coast is the Path of the Gods. It was another insane drive to get up to the trailhead. We went the wrong way down a one-way road with no way to turn around. We had no choice but to open someone’s gate and go into their property to turn around. They came outside and yelled at us in Italian. Anyways, the hike lives up to its name. It was a long, narrow trail with goats, donkeys, horses, farms, and rock climbing alongside. About every mile, there was a bend to overlook a new town below, along the coast. We only went halfway and turned around to go back to the car because we had plans to go to Ravello later that day.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="caption">To get from Minori to Ravello, we could have done another stressful drive or tried an adventure on the “Lemon Trail” connecting the two cities. Minori had lemon farms scattered everywhere around the hillsides, and the area is known for its lemon products (including granita). Online, it said the path was up 1500 stairs. It must have been more than that. In the beginning, we had no idea where we were going and were only blindly following a blue line on Google Maps. About 100 stairs in, we came across some construction workers and asked, “Ravello?” and pointed up the stairs. They said, “si, si” so we kept going. The trail is tucked between large villas that seem to be abandoned or vacation homes. It was so interesting that people might walk this brutal path to get to and from their houses. Getting to the top of the stairs was such a relief. I forgot how rewarding it is to do something so physically challenging. On the way down, a cat followed us for what seemed like a mile before stopping and turning back up. That’s a picture of the cat, and my dad and I joked that the cat wanted some salami we had at our place. When we got back to Minori from Ravello, we had to walk back up the final ascent to the lemon farm. The last picture is of me at the very end of the hike close to the accommodation. We did the Path of the Gods and the Lemon Trail on the same day, walking over 14 miles altogether.</p>

                <p class="caption">My dad was interested in Ravello because they have a classical music festival at two famous villas on the cliffs every year. We toured both of them, and the stages were platforms hanging off the cliff. I would be scared to play music there. Besides the festival, Ravello is best known for Villa Cimbrone, a bougie event space with magnificent gardens and a terrace hanging off a cliff with statues of historical figures. I snapped this picture of a random woman posing on the terrace. What a beautiful picture!</p>

                </div>
                <p class="caption">The town of Amalfi is accessible and lively. We went there for an afternoon and evening at the beach, exploring the Greek and Arab architecture at the church, dinner at a restaurant recommended by our tour guide in Sicily, and lemon granita. They had at least four unique variations of lemon gelato and granita at the gelato shop. Positano, on the other hand, was very difficult to approach. There was a one-lane loop off the main drag riddled with tourists strolling around. It took forever to travel the loop and get back on the main road. The town of Positano was nothing to write home about. But the beach at the bottom was something out of a movie. Standing in the water and turning around, seeing the houses built into the hillside, I was thinking to myself, “Is this real? Am I dreaming?” I can still picture that visual in my head vividly.</p>

            <h3>Sorrento</h3>
            <div class="image-caption-wrapper double-image">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="Amalfi_SorrentoView.jpg" alt="Sorrento View" class="blog-post-img">
                    <img src="Amalfi_Vesuvius.jpg" alt="Vesuvius" class="blog-post-img">
                </div>
                <p class="caption">The insane driving was inescapable. It was clear you needed a moped on the Amalfi Coast. I now know for next time. We stayed at an ancient monastery on top of another mountain. It is now a family-owned olive-farm agriturismo run by three generations of women. They provided delicious buffet-style dinners every night, accompanied by their homemade olive oil and bread. To the South, there was a view of Sorrento, and to the North, a view of Naples and the Vesuvius volcano. People don’t realize how influenced Italian history is by volcanic activity with Etna and Vesuvius (I haven’t even mentioned Stromboli). The tour guide from Sicily I mentioned before, Mimo is from Naples, and he said he lives every day scared that Vesuvius could erupt at any point. </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Naples</h3>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper double-image">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="Amalfi_Maradona.jpg" alt="Maradona" class="blog-post-img">
                    <img src="Amalfi_NaplesThreater.jpg" alt="Naples Theater" class="blog-post-img">
                </div>
                <p class="caption">Naples was one of a kind. There were clothes and bedding hung out to dry outside every apartment window. Some locals joked that drying laundry is their “National Flag”. Also, the city had a lot more local people out and about instead of the other cities I visited. Many other big cities in Europe seem to be dominated by tourists. However, Naples is definitely dominated by the locals. It was a melting pot of different cultures as there was every type of person walked in the streets. Even though he played almost 30 years ago, Maradona’s influence was all over the city. Maradona, considered one of the best soccer players of all time, played for Napoli for most of his club career. Every street vendor was selling a version of his jersey, and there were murals of him everywhere. Lastly, my dad and I went to the famous Naples theater. It ended up being a surprising highlight. The architecture was unmodified and original from 1737 with a perch in the back middle, where the king would watch the shows. It made me time travel back to that period. </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Overall</h3>
            <p>I don’t think I will ever get over how insane the driving was in this part of the world. However, it really inspired me to get a moped back here in America. I will work on getting one to take around town soon.</p>
