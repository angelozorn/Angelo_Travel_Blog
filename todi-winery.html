        <h2>Todi</h2>
        <p>
           I volunteered at a vineyard in the city of Todi in Umbria. One of my mom’s friends was connected to a small winery in this region owned by Sally and Rolly. It was a dream of mine to experience farm life and I got to experience luxury farm life with generous hosts. 
        </p>
        
        <section class="post-content">
            <h3>Todi Winery</h3>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper double-image">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="Todi_GroceryMeats.jpg" alt="Grocery Meats" class="blog-post-img">
                    <img src="Todi_ProciuttoLeg.jpg" alt="Prosciutto Leg" class="blog-post-img">
                </div>
                <p class="caption">The first thing I did with Sally after she picked me up from the train station was go to the local grocery store. I was impressed by the variety and freshness of deli meats. They had a pig leg ready to be cut right before you by the butcher and produce prosciutto. Almost all the meat in Italy was pig.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper double-image">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="Todi_PickingRow.jpg" alt="Row Of Grapes" class="blog-post-img">
                    <img src="Todi_PickingPartners.jpg" alt="Picking Friends" class="blog-post-img">
                </div>
                <p class="caption">Sally and Rolly’s harvest was already complete so I picked grapes at a neighboring vineyard. It was very generous of Sally to give me a ride at 6:30 AM. I picked Sangiovese grapes all day with friends from England who volunteered at this neighboring vineyard all summer. They got accommodation, food, and wine in exchange for winemaking. A lot of young people begin volunteering on vineyards to gain experience in hopes of getting a paid job at a larger winery in a few years.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper"> 
                <img src="Todi_WineryView.jpg" alt="Winery View" class="blog-post-img"> 
                <p class="caption">Just like many places I visited before, Sally and Rolly’s winery was on top of a hill with a distant view of rolling hills and the town of Todi. The view constantly changed due to the interacting sun, clouds, and rain.</p> 
            </div>      

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper double-image">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="Todi_PoolView.jpg" alt="Pool View" class="blog-post-img">
                    <img src="Todi_OutsideTableByPool.jpg" alt="Outside Table" class="blog-post-img">
                </div>
                <p class="caption">This was the pool area. The water was freezing! It had a poolside terrace and table where we tasted Sally and Rolly’s wines with the English guys volunteering at the other winery. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper"> 
                <img src="Todi_GrapesBug.jpg" alt="Bug on Grapes" class="blog-post-img"> 
                <p class="caption">The winery was organic, so many imperfect grapes and insects were on the bunches. The process went slowly because after picking a bunch off the vine, I had to remove the imperfect grapes, the bugs, and spiderwebs before placing them in the basket. </p> 
            </div>

            <div class="image-caption-wrapper"> 
                <img src="Todi_GrapesDrum.jpg" alt="Grapes in Wine Drum" class="blog-post-img"> 
                <p class="caption">Grapes in the wine drum where the fermentation happened. Rolly gave me a full tour and demonstration of their wine production. I even got to taste the grape juice from their recent harvest - it was so sweet.</p> 
            </div>

            <h3>Overall</h3>
            <p>This was a luxury farm experience. I loved it. However, I still want to have another tougher farm experience. Maybe kill a pig and make sausage or something like that.</p>
